## 🧪 Algorithm Details

### Novel Gradient Field Pathfinding

Our novel algorithm uses a **physics-inspired approach** that treats pathfinding as particle navigation through a potential field:

#### Core Concepts

1. **Potential Field Construction**
   - Creates attractive potential radiating from the goal
   - Uses BFS-like wavefront expansion for preprocessing
   - Adds Gaussian repulsive potentials around obstacles

2. **Gradient Descent with Momentum**
   - Performs gradient descent from start position
   - Incorporates momentum for smooth, natural movement
   - Includes cycle detection and escape mechanisms

3. **Completeness Guarantee**
   - Falls back to deterministic iterative deepening search
   - Explores cells in Manhattan distance rings
   - Guarantees finding optimal path if one exists

| Parameter | Description | Default | Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `momentumFactor` | Momentum persistence (0=none, 0.9=high) | 0.7 | 0.0-0.95 |
| `repulsionSigma` | Gaussian wall repulsion spread | 1.5 | 0.5-3.0 |
| `repulsionStrength` | Wall repulsion force strength | 10.0 | 1.0-20.0 |

## 📚 Algorithm Theory

### Physics-Inspired Pathfinding

The novel algorithm draws inspiration from:
- **Electrostatic Fields**: Goal acts as attractive charge
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Smooth particle flow around obstacles
- **Momentum Mechanics**: Inertial movement for natural paths
- **Escape Velocity**: Random perturbations to avoid local minima

### Mathematical Foundation

The potential field U(x,y) combines:
1. **Attractive Potential**: U_goal = -k * distance_to_goal
2. **Repulsive Potential**: U_wall = Σ A * exp(-d²/2σ²) for nearby walls  
3. **Gradient Computation**: ∇U = (∂U/∂x, ∂U/∂y)
4. **Momentum Update**: v_new = α * v_old + β * (-∇U)
